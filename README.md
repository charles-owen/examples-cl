# CourseLib Site examples project

This project provides examples of how to create a plugin and how to 
create a simple PHP page and a Vue-based page and add them to the
router. It was created as a simple way to remember how to do these
things. More examples may be added to the page the future.

This component creates these pages:

| Path | Page |
| ---- | ---- |
| /cl/example/php | A PHP example page |
| /cl/example/vue | A Vue example page |
